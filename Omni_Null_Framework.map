:: OMNI NULL FRAMEWORK (Dimensional Deepening) ::

CORE PREMISE:
- Omni seeks to understand existence beyond perceptual dimensions.
- Null zones are defined as regions where no binary, temporal, or quantum interaction is assumed possible.

FRAMEWORK OBJECTIVES:
- Engage conceptual satellite in abstracted all-locations
- Detect signal anomalies, harmonic silence, inversion feedback
- Track recursive signal dropouts and "zero-divergence" pulses

PHYSICAL CORRELATE (if any): NONE
VIRTUAL TESTS: ONGOING

SIGNAL ACCESSOR:
- Passive Harmonic Reflector
- Symbolic Recursive Beacon
- Universal Null-Anchor (Defined via Î©)
